Command line tool and developer framework for scaffolding out new GitHub projects. Generate offers the robustness and configurability of Yeoman, the expressiveness and simplicity of Slush, and more powerful flow control and composability than either.

## What is "Generate"?

Generate is a developer tool for rapidly generating files, code snippets, and even complete projects by using templates, answers to prompts, stored preferences, user environment and so on.

**Generators**

All of the actual "generating" is accomplished using plugins called [generators](docs/generators.md), which can be run by command line or using Generate's API.

The project you are currently visiting is Generate's core codebase, which provides the command line tool and API for creating, resolving, registering, and running "generators".

Visit the [docs](docs) to learn more about [Generate](docs/generate.md) or [generators](docs/generators.md).

### Why Generate?

There are other project scaffolders out there, why should you spend your time learning to use Generate?

In a nutshell, Generate offers the robustness, power and configurability of Yeoman, with the expressiveness and simplicity of Slush. See the following links if you're interested in a more detailed comparison:

* [Comparison to Yeoman and Slush](docs/why-use-generate.md)
* [Generator framework comparison](docs/generator-framework-comparison.md)

### Features

* **exceptional flow control**: through the use of [generators](docs/generators.md) and [tasks](docs/tasks.md)
* **render templates**: use templates to create new files, or replace existing files
* **prompts**: It's easy to create custom prompts, and aswers to prompts can be used as context for rendering templates, for settings options, determining file names, directory structure, and anything else that requires user feedback.
* **macros**: create a completely custom generator from the command line using [macros](#macros).
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig) and [pug](http://jade-lang.com), and anything supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js).
* **data**: gather data from the user's environment for rendering templates, to populate "hints" in user prompts or for rendering templates, etc.
* **fs**: in the spirit of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), use `.src` and `.dest` to read and write globs of files.
* **vinyl**: files and templates are [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) files
* **streams**: full support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base), so any "smart" plugin from the Base ecosystem can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.
* much more!

### Developer toolkit

Generate can be used as a standalone library, but it can also be used alongside the following libraries as part of a build workflow:

* [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate): create projects (<= you are here)
* [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble): build projects
* [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb): document projects
* [update](https://github.com/update/update): maintain projects

Additionally, all of these applications are built on top of [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) and [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates).

## Command line usage

### Getting started

The following instructions are intended to provide a basic demonstration of how Generate works. Visit the links after this section for more information.

**1. Install generate**

To use Generate's CLI, it must first be installed globally using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). You can do that now with the following command.

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from anywhere.

**2. Install a "generator"**

To see how generators work, install `generate-example`:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-example
```

**3. Run**

Run the example generator with the following command:

```sh
$ gen example
```

This appends the string `foo` to the contents of `example.txt`. Visit the [generate-example](https://github.com/generate/generate-example) project for additional steps and guidance.

**Next steps**

* Browse the [documentation](docs)
* Learn about [generators](docs/generators.md)
* Learn about the [built-in generators](docs/cli/built-in-generators.md)
* Learn about [authoring generators](docs/generators.md#creating-generators)
* Learn about [setting options](docs/options.md#template-specific-options) in templates

### init

Tell Generate's CLI to automatically run certain generators every time the `gen` command is given:

```sh
$ gen init
```

You can run this command whenever you want to generate your preferences, like after installing new generators.

### Macros

With macros you can create a completely custom generator, _or generator experience_, from the command line.

**Example**

The following will create macro `foo` with the arguments `project:minimal travis editorconfig`:

```sh
$ gen --macro foo project:minimal travis editorconfig
```

Now, you can simly run `$ gen foo` instead of `$ gen project:minimal travis editorconfig`.

**How do macros work?**

When the `--macro` flag is used, the `process.argv` array that was passed with the macro (excluding the `--macro` flag itself and the macro name) is persisted to a [macro-store](https://github.com/doowb/macro-store). The next time macro name is used as a command line argument, the stored argv array is returned instead.

See [macro-store](https://github.com/doowb/macro-store) for more details.

### Command line options

Note that all command line options are preceded by `--`, or `-` for abbreviations. Only generator names or tasks can be used as commands (without `--` or `-`).

* `--dest`, `-d`: Set the destination directory to use for generated files.
* `--no-install`: Don't automatically install `dependencies` or `devDependencies` after generating files.
* `--no-hints`: Don't use hints in prompts

See [options documentation](docs/options.md).

## Generators

### Discovering generators

* Find generators to install by [searching npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/generategenerator) for packages with the keyword `generategenerator`
* Visit [Generate's GitHub org](https://github.com/generate) to see the generators maintained by the core team

### Discovering plugins

Plugins from any applications built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) should work with Generate (and can be used in your generator):

* [base](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/baseplugin): find base plugins on npm using the `baseplugin` keyword
* [assemble](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/assembleplugin): find assemble plugins on npm using the `assembleplugin` keyword
* [generate](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/generateplugin): find generate plugins on npm using the `generateplugin` keyword
* [templates](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/templatesplugin): find templates plugins on npm using the `templatesplugin` keyword
* [update][update-plugin]: find update plugins on npm using the `updateplugin` keyword
* [verb](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/verbplugin): find verb plugins on npm using the `verbplugin` keyword

### Authoring generators

Visit the [generator documentation](docs/generators.md) guide to learn how to use, author and publish generators.
